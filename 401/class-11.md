# Class 11 Reading Notes

## Introduction

This reading covers the fundamentals of Event Driven Programming in Node.js, the synergy between Object-Oriented Programming and Event Driven Programming, and the practical applications of these concepts in backend development.

## Notes

### What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?

The native Node.js module that allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming is the events module.

### What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) enhances Event Driven Programming (EDP) by organizing code into objects that encapsulate data and behavior. This modular approach simplifies the complexity of large systems, making them easier to manage and scale. When combined with EDP, OOP allows for efficient communication between objects through events, reducing interdependencies and increasing code reusability.

### Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.

Imagine you’re running a café. Instead of one person taking orders, making coffee, and delivering it, you have a system where each task is handled by different people, each responding to specific signals. In Node.js, Event Driven Programming works similarly. When a customer places an order (event), it triggers the barista to start making coffee without waiting for other tasks to complete. This makes the system efficient and responsive, handling multiple orders seamlessly.

### Looking ahead at this module’s course schedule, what do you look forward to learning?

Looking ahead at this module’s course schedule, I am excited to delve into more complex topics like asynchronous programming, advanced data handling, and integrating various backend frameworks and databases.

### What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?

After reading and reviewing the class README, my learning goals include gaining a thorough understanding of backend development principles using Node.js, mastering event-driven architecture, and applying these skills to build robust and scalable applications through hands-on projects and real-world scenarios.
