### How do useReducer and useContext work together to simplify state management in a React application?

`useReducer` and `useContext` work together by combining their strengths to manage complex state and avoid prop drilling. `useReducer` is used to handle state transitions in a predictable manner, especially when state logic is intricate and involves multiple actions or sub-values. It centralizes the state logic in a reducer function, making the code easier to maintain, debug, and test. By defining a clear set of actions and a reducer function, `useReducer` ensures that state changes are consistent and manageable, even as the application grows in complexity.

`useContext` complements `useReducer` by providing a way to share state across the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. By wrapping the component tree with a `Context.Provider` that supplies the state and dispatch function from `useReducer`, all components within the tree can access the state and dispatch actions directly through the `useContext` hook. This approach eliminates the need for prop drilling, enhances code readability, and promotes a cleaner and more scalable architecture. Together, `useReducer` and `useContext` offer a powerful combination for managing global state in a React application, making it easier to build and maintain large-scale applications with complex state requirements.
