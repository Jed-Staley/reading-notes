# Class 28 Reading Notes

## Introduction

This reading covers the fundamentals of the `useEffect` hook in React, its primary use cases, and the significance of its return value.

## Notes

### What is the main intended use case for the useEffect hook?

The main intended use case for the `useEffect` hook is to handle side effects in functional components. This includes tasks like data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM that cannot be done during rendering.

### How does the effect’s logic interact with the component?

The effect’s logic interacts with the component by running after the render phase. It can access the component's state and props and perform actions like updating state, interacting with external APIs, or setting up subscriptions. The effect runs after every render by default, but it can be controlled to run only when certain dependencies change.

### What is the importance of the return value from the effect’s logic function?

The return value from the effect’s logic function is used for cleanup. When the component unmounts or before the effect runs again due to a change in dependencies, the cleanup function is executed. This is important for avoiding memory leaks, unsubscribing from subscriptions, or cleaning up any other side effects that were set up in the effect.

## Reflection

### What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?

My learning goals include understanding how to effectively use the `useEffect` hook to manage side effects, learning to optimize performance by controlling when effects run, and mastering the cleanup process to ensure resource management and avoid memory leaks in React applications.
