# Class 39 Reading Notes

## Introduction

This reading covers the Redux Toolkit (RTK) and MobX, focusing on their features, benefits, and how they simplify state management in React applications. Additionally, it includes insights from a tutorial and other relevant resources.

## Notes

### What concerns are addressed by Redux Toolkit?

Redux Toolkit addresses several concerns, including:

- Reducing boilerplate code required to set up and manage Redux.
- Simplifying the configuration of the Redux store.
- Providing efficient and standard ways to handle immutable state updates.
- Integrating Redux DevTools and middleware by default.

### What does configureStore() do?

`configureStore()` is a function provided by Redux Toolkit that simplifies the store setup process. It automatically sets up the Redux DevTools, applies the middleware, and allows for easy integration of reducers.

Example:

```javascript
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import rootReducer from './reducers';

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: rootReducer,
});
```

### How would I use createSlice()?

`createSlice()` is a function provided by Redux Toolkit that helps create a slice of the Redux state, including the reducer logic and actions. It combines `createAction` and `createReducer` in one step.

Example:

```javascript
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'counter',
  initialState: { value: 0 },
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => {
      state.value += 1;
    },
    decrement: (state) => {
      state.value -= 1;
    },
  },
});

export const { increment, decrement } = counterSlice.actions;
export default counterSlice.reducer;
```

### What is MobX?

MobX is a state management library that makes state management simple and scalable by using reactive programming principles. It automatically tracks and reacts to state changes, making it easier to build reactive applications.

### How does MobX make it “impossible” to produce an inconsistent state?

MobX makes it “impossible” to produce an inconsistent state by using observable state and reactions. Any changes to the state are automatically propagated to all dependent reactions, ensuring that the state remains consistent throughout the application.

### How would we build a reactive user interface?

To build a reactive user interface with MobX:

1. Define observable state using `observable`.
2. Create reactions using `autorun` or `reaction` to automatically respond to state changes.
3. Use observer components that automatically re-render when the observed state changes.

Example:

```javascript
import { observable } from 'mobx';
import { observer } from 'mobx-react';

const appState = observable({
  count: 0,
  increment() {
    this.count++;
  },
});

const Counter = observer(() => (
  <div>
    <button onClick={() => appState.increment()}>Count: {appState.count}</button>
  </div>
));
```

### What take-away(s) did this tutorial provide?

The tutorial provided valuable insights into the practical use of Redux Toolkit and MobX, demonstrating how these tools simplify state management and improve the scalability and maintainability of React applications. Key takeaways include understanding the benefits of using `configureStore` and `createSlice` with Redux Toolkit, and leveraging MobX's reactive state management to build responsive user interfaces.

## Reflection

### What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?

My learning goals include mastering the use of Redux Toolkit for efficient state management, understanding how to leverage MobX for reactive programming, and exploring best practices for building scalable and maintainable state management solutions in React applications. Additionally, I aim to integrate these tools into real-world projects and evaluate their benefits and trade-offs.
