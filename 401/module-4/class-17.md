# Class 17 Reading Notes

## Introduction

This reading covers the fundamentals of Amazon S3, AWS Lambda, and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs). It explores their use cases, benefits, and how they work, along with an introduction to the concept of serverless computing.

## Notes

### What is Amazon S3?

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is an object storage service that offers scalable, high-speed, web-based cloud storage.

### Name some use cases for Amazon S3

1. Storing and backing up data and media files.
2. Hosting static websites and content.
3. Data archiving and disaster recovery.

### Name some benefits of using Amazon S3

- Scalability: Automatically scales storage capacity as needed.
- Durability: Provides high durability and availability for stored data.
- Security: Offers robust security features for data protection.
- Cost-effective: Pay-as-you-go pricing model.

### What is AWS Lambda?

AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that runs code in response to events and automatically manages the underlying compute resources.

### Name some use cases for AWS Lambdas

1. Running backend code in response to HTTP requests via API Gateway.
2. Real-time file processing, such as image resizing or transcoding.
3. Automated administrative tasks and event-driven processing.

### Describe “serverless” to a non-technical friend

Serverless means you don't have to manage or worry about the servers that run your code. You just write your code, and the cloud service provider takes care of running it and scaling it as needed.

### What is a CDN?

A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a network of servers distributed across various locations to deliver content to users more efficiently and quickly.

### How does a CDN work with relation to the website visitor?

When a website visitor requests content, the CDN serves it from the server closest to their location, reducing latency and improving load times.

### What are the benefits of employing a CDN?

- Faster content delivery and improved user experience.
- Reduced load on the origin server.
- Enhanced security through distributed infrastructure.
- Better handling of traffic spikes and high availability.

## Reflection

### What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?

My learning goals include understanding how to leverage Amazon S3 for efficient and secure data storage, mastering AWS Lambda for serverless application development, and implementing CDNs to enhance content delivery and performance in web applications.
