# This reading covers how psychological wellbeing effects teams' productivity

## Discussion Questions

1. Three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams:

     * An equal amount of input from each member.

     * Emotionally sensitive members that will react accordingly to their teammates behaviors and communication.

     * A group norm of valued communication, so that each member feels free to share what they think is important or relevant.

2. In my time at Amazon, our team was rather small (only 4 members), and whenever there was a problem that needed solving we would not hesitate to through out ideas and also to judge which ideas were better safely. We got along well together and were able to get through much of the workday as friends rather than teammates.

3. These teams that perform well in psychological safety help the company to succeed in its core goals, and also give the teammates a higher feeling of accomplishment, purpose, and meaning in their work so that their work life is not something totally seperate from who they are.
