# This reading furthered concepts relating to HTML, CSS, and especially JS.

## HTML

1. An unordered list should be used when changing the order of the items in the list does not change its meaning.

2. The attribute "type" has been deprecated and therefore the CSS property list-style-type should be used.

3. You should use an ordered list when changing the order of the items in the list chnages their meaning.

4. The attribute reversed which lists the numbers in reverse order and the attribute type which changes the types of numbers displays (Roman numerals are an option, for example)

## CSS

1. Margin provides distance between the border and other elements, which helps to keep things seperate. Padding is distance between the border and the content of the block, which can help with asthetic and readability.

2. 4 parts:

   * Margin: The distance between the border and other elements

   * Border: A lining around the content box which can be altered so that it is visible

   * Padding: THe distance between the border and the content

   * Content box: The space in which the content of the block is allowed to be displayed

## JS

1. Arrays can store all data types.

2. Yes, the array is valid. Its values can be accessed using people[x] where x is the index of the item which you wish to access. Note that arrays are not made immutable by using the constant declaration, this simply binds the constant variable to this array permanently, but the array can still be changed.

3. 5 Operators:

   * '+=' Adds the value to its right to the variable on its left and reassigns the variable on its left to this new value.

   * '-=' Subtracts the value to its right from the variable on its left and reassigns the variable on its left to this new value.

   * '*=' Multiplies the value to its right by the variable on its left and reassigns the variable on its left to this new value.

   * '++' Adds 1 to the variable on its left and reassigns that variable to this new value.

   * '--' Subtracts 1 from the variable on its left and reassigns that variable to this new value.

4. The result would be '10dog' because first, when the '+' operator is used with a number and a boolean, it treats a true as a 1 and a false as a 0, so 10 + false is 10. Then when the '+' operator is used in conjunction with a string is converts the other value to a string as well and simply combines the two strings.

5. A conditional statement can be used to check whether a user has permissions to access a feature of your website before granting them access.

6. Loops are useful when iteration is required, such as when you want to reverse a string. One method would be to iterate through each character in reverse, adding them all to a new string.
