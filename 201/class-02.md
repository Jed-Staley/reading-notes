# This reaing covers important basics of HTML, CSS, and JS which will all be important for this course.

## HTML

1. HTML Semantics are important because they provide general information to the browser about the structuring of your page's elements. There are ways to acheive the same visual results for the default user using CSS, but these do not work for any case other than the default user and therefore are terrible for accessability compared to HTML semantics.

2. The are 6 levels of headings in HTML: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6.

3. Superscripts are often used for exponents, subscripts are often used for molecular formulas.

4. The title element must be given the value of the full term as a string.

## CSS

1. As a seperate style sheet or inline in the HTML.

2. Using inline styles make it difficult to change things accross multiple web pages.

3. "h2"

4. "color: black;
     padding: 5px;"

5. "color" and "padding"

## Javascript

1. Strings

2. Addition, subtraction, multiplication and division

3. A calculator function would allow the user to solve real world problems involving data analysis easily.

## Conditionals

2. It can be used to create further conditionals that are reliant on all previous conditionals in the chain returning false.

3. === and !==, < and >, <= and >=

4. && represents an "and" gate, || represents an "or" gate
