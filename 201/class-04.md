# This content prepares for greater freedom in styling the webpage with CSS, linking between multiple pages, and cleaner JS code using functions

## HTML

1. <a> tags

2. The href property should contain the url.

3. Make sure the link text is descriptive and write a useful but concise title.

## CSS

1. Normal flow is how elements arrange themselves on the webpage by default without any css styling.

2. A block-level element grows to fit its parent, whereas an inline element is the width and height of its conntent. Block elements will always be on a new line, but inline elements can be side by side on the same line.

3. Static

4. Absolute positioning allows for an element to be displayed over other elements and allows for it to be moved around on the page without affecting the flow of its surrounding elements.

5. Absolute positioning places an element in its own layer within its containing body, whereas fixed positioning places an element in its own layer within the viewport.

## JS

1. A function declaration defines code to be run when the function is invoked but does not run the code. A function invocation runs the code within the function that is called.

2. There is no difference between a parameter and an argument.

## Miscellaneous

1. Pair programming makes it easy to learn from other students. It exposes both members of the pair to the strategies and methodologies of the other, which can be beneficial for both. It also prepares students for job interviews of the same nature, which would be very difficult without prior experience.
