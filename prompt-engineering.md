Output:

# Output:

Buy a smoke, a molly, and 2 flashes. Start by smoking off the entrance to B site to block vision from any CTs playing close. Follow it up with a flash to blind any opponents near the entrance. Quickly check the close angles as you enter.

Once you're past the initial choke point, use one of your flashes to clear any corners or angles where CTs might be hiding. Coordinate with your team if possible to ensure you're not exposed while executing this.

Next, throw your molly towards common hiding spots or angles where CTs might be holding, such as behind the pillar or close to the stairs. This will force them to reposition or take damage if they're caught in the flames.

Finally, use your remaining flash to further disorient any remaining opponents or to support your teammates as they push onto the site. Communicate with your team throughout the push to coordinate your efforts and maximize your chances of success.
